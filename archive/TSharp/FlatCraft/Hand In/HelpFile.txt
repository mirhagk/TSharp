~~~~~~~~~~Modifying textures~~~~~~~~~~
All images are located in the "images" folder.
You can modify them, but you must make sure that you dont modify the size of the files/textures, or the positions of items.
Being so, you can use files from Minecraft texture packs in this game as they are loaded the same, except fire.gif.
If you modify terrain.gif or items.gif, you will need to run the ApplyTexturePack.exe file to apply the changes.

~~~~~~~~~~Modifying audio~~~~~~~~~~
You can modify the audio, as long as you dont modify the name, filetype and extension.

~~~~~~~~~~Adding/Modifying blocks and items~~~~~~~~~~
There are 2 files in the datafiles folder called blocks.txt and tools.txt. You can modify both but if adding an item/block you must run the ApplyTexturePack.exe

Blocks.txt : Contains the information about all blocks, these are textures retrieved from the terrain file. You can copy and paste a section to create a new one.
	ID = The unique id for the block
	X = the leftmost x pixel position in the texture file
	Y = the bottommost y pixel position in the texture file
	Name = The name that will be displayed on mouseover in the inventory
	Hardness = How much time in milliseconds it takes to break the block with your fist
	Weakness = The tool type that destroys the block more efficiently, 0:no best tool, 1:pickaxe, 2:shovel, 3:axe, 4:sword
	ToolTypeRequired = Whether or not the block requires the tool to drop an entity (True or False)
	Tool = Whether or not the block is a tool, this is always false, so just dont touch it.
IMPORTANT: You must update the number of items in NumBlocks.txt for the addition of blocks or its texture won't be loaded.
You can then either create a recipe for this or modify the level file of your save to include the item.
Lines 9 and on are the inventory items, arraged as ID\nAmount\nID\nAmount etc.

Items.txt : Contains all the information about the items, these are textures from the items.gif file. You can use the same process as blocks for these items to add them.
	ID = The unique id for the item
	X = the leftmost x pixel position in the texture file
	Y = the bottommost y pixel position in the texture file
	Name = The name that will be displayed on mouseover in the inventory
	strength = The multiplier of how much faster it breaks the item/kills zombies
	tooltype = Which tooltype it is 0:not a tool, 1:pickaxe, 2:shovel, 3:axe, 4:sword
	tool = Whether or not its a tool
	durability = How many uses it can withstand before breaking
	placable = Whether or not it can be placed into the world (As a block), it is inverted (1 = not placable, 0 = placable)

~~~~~~~~~~Adding/Modifying crafting recipes~~~~~~~~~~
There are 2 files for recipes, recipes.txt and recipes2x2.txt, the first is for the crafting table, and the second is for the inventory crafting.
They are arranged the same except the crafting table has an extra row and column.
You can modify these, they are in the format of:
	[ID][ID][ID]
	[ID][ID][ID]
	[ID][ID][ID]
	[Output ID]
	[Output Amount]
For 2x2 its the same minus a row and column of IDs
